The `docker run` command below exposes redis-server on port 6379 and RedisInsight on port 8001. You can use RedisInsight by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:8001`.

```shell
# install
$ docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

You can use `redis-cli` to connect to the server at `localhost:6379`. If you donâ€™t have `redis-cli` installed locally, you can run it from the Docker container like below:

```shell
# connect
$ docker exec -it redis-stack redis-cli
```
