import RedisCard from '@site/src/theme/RedisCard';



### Step 1. Preparing the Heroku environment

[Follow the link](../create/heroku) to setup Redis database on Heroku



### Step 2. Prepare the app

In this step, you will prepare a sample application that’s ready to be deployed to Heroku.


```
$ git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs
$ cd basic-redis-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs

```


You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.

### Step 3. Deploy the app

It is recommended to use Redis Enterprise Cloud Page for creating the database as it allows you to add Redis modules of your choice. Also, it provides you freedom to choose Cloud other than AWS for creating the database.


In this step you will deploy the app to Heroku.
Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.



```
heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ rocky-lowlands-06306
https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/rocky-lowlands-06306.git
```

When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.

### Step 4. Deploy your code

Heroku generates a random name (in this case pure-mesa-54685) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
Now deploy your code:

```
$ git push heroku
```

Wait for few seconds and you will see the below messages being displayed:

```
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        Released v3
remote:        https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote: 
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/rocky-lowlands-06306.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main

```

### Step 5. Accessing the application


Open https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/   to see your application
