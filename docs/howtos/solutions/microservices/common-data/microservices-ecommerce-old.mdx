The e-commerce microservices application consists of a frontend, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The application backend uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). The data is stored in
[Redis](https://redis.com/try-free/) and MongoDB. Below you will find screenshots of the frontend of the e-commerce app:

- `Dashboard`: Shows the list of products with search functionality
