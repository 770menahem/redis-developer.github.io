You can use **Redis Enterprise** as a multi-model primary database. Redis Enterprise is a fully managed, highly available, secure, and real-time data platform. It can store data on both RAM or **Flash**. It also supports **Active-Active** (multi-zone read and write replicas) on different cloud vendors, providing extreme high availability and scalability. Active-Active offers global scalability while maintaining local speed for database reads and writes.

Redis Enterprise has many built-in modular capabilities, making it a unified, real-time data platform. Redis Enterprise is far more than a document database.

- **RedisJSON**: Persists JSON documents
- **RediSearch**: Indexes and searches JSON documents
- **RedisGraph**: A fast and easy-to-use graph database
- **RedisBloom:** Provides bloom filters and other probabilistic data structures
- **RedisTimeSeries**: Supports time series data structures
- **RedisGears**: Syncs data to external databases via different pattern (write-behind/ write-through) or executes custom logic.
