You eventually land on the following architecture:

1. `products service`: handles querying products from the database and returning them to the frontend
1. `orders service`: handles validating and creating orders
1. `order history service`: handles querying a customer's order history
1. `payments service`: handles processing orders for payment
1. `api gateway`: unifies the services under a single endpoint
1. `mongodb`: serves as the write-optimized database for storing orders, order history, products, etc.

You donâ€™t need to use MongoDB as your write-optimized database; you can use other databases such as a SQL database as well. This is just an example.
