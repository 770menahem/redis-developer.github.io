- **Over and under-stocking**: While adopting a multi-channel business model (online & in store), lack of inventory visibility results in over and under-stocking of inventory in different regions and stores.

- Consumers **seek convenience**: The ability to search across regional store locations and pickup merchandise **immediately** rather than wait for shipping is a key differentiator for retailers.

- Consumers **seek speed**: All retailers, even small or family-run, must compete against the **customer experience** of large online retailers like Alibaba, FlipKart, Shopee, and Amazon.

- **High inventory costs**: Retailers seek to lower inventory costs by eliminating missed sales from out-of-stock scenarios which also leads to higher “inventory turnover ratios.”

- **Brand value**: Inaccurate store inventory counts lead to frustrated customers and lower sales. The operational pain will **impact the status quo**.
