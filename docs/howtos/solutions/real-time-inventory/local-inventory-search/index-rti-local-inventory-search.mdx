## What is real-time local inventory search?

**Real-time local inventory search** is a method of utilizing advanced product search capabilities across a group of stores or warehouses in a region or geographic area by which a retailer can enhance the customer experience with a localized view of inventory while fulfilling orders from the closest store possible.

GeoSpatial search of merchandise local to consumer helps sell stock faster, lowers inventory levels, and thus reduces days sales in inventory and increases inventory turnover ratio.
Consumers locate product online, placer order on cell phone and pick up at nearest store location, called “buy-online-pickup-in-store” (BOPIS)

## Current challenges in real time inventory

<RealTimeInventoryChallenges />

## Why you should use Redis for local inventory search

- **Accurate location/regional inventory search**: Redis Enterprise geo-spatial search capabilities enables retailers to provide local inventories by store location across geographies and regions based on consumer's location. This provides mobile with a real-time view of store inventory and enables seamless BOPIS shopping experiences

- **Consistent and accurate inventory view across multichannel and omnichannel experiences**: Accurate inventory information no matter what channel the shopper is using, in-store, Kiosk, online or mobile

- **Real-time search performance at scale**: Redis Enterprise real time search engine allows retailers to provide instant application and inventory search responses and scale performance painlessly during peak periods

## Real-time local inventory search with Redis

Redis provides geospatial search capabilities across a group of stores or warehouses in a region or geographic area allowing a retailer to quickly show the available inventory local to the customer.

Redis Enterprise processes event streams keeping store inventories up to date in real-time enhancing the customer experience with localized, accurate search of inventory while fulfilling orders from the closest and fewest stores possible.

This solution lowers days sales of inventory - selling inventory faster and carrying less inventory for increased revenue generation and profits over a shorter time period.

It also reduces fulfillment costs to home and local stores enhancing retailer's ability to fulfill orders with the least amount of delivery or shipping costs

### Setting up data

Once the application source code is downloaded , run following commands to setup data in Redis

```sh
# install packages
npm install

# Seed data to Redis
npm run seed
```

The demo uses twi collections :

- **Product collection** : Stores product details like productId, name , price , image and other details
  ![product data](./images/product-data.png)

- **StoresInventory collection** : Stores product quantity available at different local stores.

  For demo purpose , we have considered below regions in NewYork State (USA) as store locations and different products (id and available quantity) are mapped to these location stores.

Let's build following APIs to demonstrate GeoSpatial search using Redis

- **InventorySearch API** : Search Products in local stores within a search radius.
- **InventorySearchWithDistance API** : Search Product in local stores within search radius and sort results by distance from current user location to store.
