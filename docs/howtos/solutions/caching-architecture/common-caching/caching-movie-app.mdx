The movie application dashboard contains a search section at the top and a list of movie cards in the middle. The floating plus icon displays a pop-up when the user selects it, permitting the user to enter new movie details. The search section has a text search bar and a toggle link between text search and basic (that is, form-based) search. Each movie card has edit and delete icons, which are displayed when a mouse hovers over the card.
