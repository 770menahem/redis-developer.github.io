## What is write behind caching?

With the **Write-behind** caching pattern, every time an application writes data to the cache, it also asynchronously updates the records in the persistent database.

Since the write-behind pattern adds the system of record to a queue, this permits the application thread to move on more quickly, but it does mean that there is a **short time** when the data between the cache and the system of record is **inconsistent**.

![pattern](./images/pattern.jpg)

The pattern works as presented :

1. The application reads and writes data to Redis.
1. Next, Redis syncs any changed data to the MongoDB database asynchronously.

## Why you should use Redis for write behind caching

Consider Redis with this pattern when you need to

- **Flatten peaks in demand** : Under stress, an application may need to write data quickly. If your application needs to perform a large number of write operations at high speed, consider Redis. The RedisGears modules make sure the data stored in the cache is synced with the database.

- **Batch multiple writes**: Sometimes it's expensive to write to a database frequently (for example, logging). In those cases, it can be cost-effective to batch the database writes with Redis so that data syncs at intervals.

- **Offload the primary database** : Database load is reduced when heavy writes operate on Redis, So we can spread writes to improve performance during the peak time of application usage.

## Write behind caching in a NodeJS application with Redis and MongoDB

### Demo application

<CachingMovieAppDesign />

<SourceCodeMovieApp />

To demonstrate this pattern using the movie application, imagine that the user opens the pop-up to add a new movie.

![demo-02](../common-caching/images/demo-02.png)

Instead of the application immediately storing the data in MongoDB, the application writes the changes to Redis. In the background, RedisGears automatically synchronizes the data with the MongoDB database.

### Gears code

Developers need to load some code (say python in our example) to the Redis server before using the write-behind pattern (which syncs data from Redis to MongoDB). The Redis server has a RedisGears module that interprets the python code and syncs the data from Redis to MongoDB.

Loading the Python code is easier than it sounds. Simply replace database details in the Python file and then load the file to the Redis server.

Create the Python file (shown below, and [available online](https://github.com/redis-developer/ebook-speed-mern-backend/blob/main/data/write-behind/movies-write-behind.py)). Then update the MongoDB connection details, database, collection, and primary key name to sync.

```python
movies-write-behind.py

# Gears Recipe for a single write behind

# import redis gears & mongo db libs
from rgsync import RGJSONWriteBehind, RGJSONWriteThrough
from rgsync.Connectors import MongoConnector, MongoConnection

# change mongodb connection (admin)
# mongodb://usrAdmin:passwordAdmin@10.10.20.2:27017/dbSpeedMernDemo?authSource=admin
mongoUrl = 'mongodb://usrAdmin:passwordAdmin@10.10.20.2:27017/admin'

# MongoConnection(user, password, host, authSource?, fullConnectionUrl?)
connection = MongoConnection('', '', '', '', mongoUrl)

# change MongoDB database
db = 'dbSpeedMernDemo'

# change MongoDB collection & it's primary key
movieConnector = MongoConnector(connection, db, 'movies', 'movieId')

# change redis keys with prefix that must be synced with mongodb collection
RGJSONWriteBehind(GB,  keysPrefix='MovieEntity',
                  connector=movieConnector, name='MoviesWriteBehind',
                  version='99.99.99')
```

:::tip What is RedisGears recipe?

A collection of RedisGears functions and any dependencies they may have that implement a high-level functional purpose is called a `recipe`.
Example : "RGJSONWriteBehind" function in above python code

:::

There are two ways to load that Python file into the Redis server:

1. using the gears command-line interface (CLI)

Find more information about the Gears CLI at [gears-cli](https://github.com/RedisGears/gears-cli) and [rgsync](https://github.com/RedisGears/rgsync#running-the-recipe).

```sh
# install
pip install gears-cli
```

```sh
# If python file is located at “/users/tom/movies-write-behind.py”
gears-cli --host <redisHost> --port <redisPort> --password <redisPassword> run /users/tom/movies-write-behind.py REQUIREMENTS rgsync pymongo==3.12.0
```

2. using the RG.PYEXECUTE from the Redis command line.

Find more information at [RG.PYEXECUTE](https://oss.redis.com/redisgears/commands.html#rgpyexecute).

```sh
# Via redis cli
RG.PYEXECUTE 'pythonCode' REQUIREMENTS rgsync pymongo==3.12.0
```

The RG.PYEXECUTE command can also be executed from the Node.js code
(Consult [the sample Node file](https://github.com/redis-developer/ebook-speed-mern-backend/blob/main/data/write-behind/wb-main.js) for more details)

Find more examples at [Redis Gears sync with MongoDB](https://github.com/RedisGears/rgsync/tree/master/examples/mongo).

### Verify sync

The next step is to verify that RedisGears is syncing data between Redis and MongoDB.

Insert a key starting with the prefix (that's specified in the Python file) using the Redis CLI

![redis-insight](./images/redis-insight.png)

Next, confirm that the JSON is inserted in MongoDB too.

/>

You can also check [Redis Insight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) to verify that the data is piped in via Streams for its consumers (like RedisGears).

![redis-insight-stream](./images/redis-insight-stream.png)

How does all that work with the demo application? Consider using snippets to insert a movie. Once data is written to Redis, Redis Gears automatically synchronizes it to MongoDB.

```js
*** BEFORE (MongoDB)***
...
//(Node mongo query)
if (movie) {
  //insert movie to MongoDB
  await db.collection("movies")
           .insertOne(movie);
}
...
```

```js
*** AFTER (Redis)***
...
//(Redis OM Node query)
if (movie) {
  const entity = repository.createEntity(movie);
  //insert movie to Redis
  await moviesRepository.save(entity);
}
...
```
