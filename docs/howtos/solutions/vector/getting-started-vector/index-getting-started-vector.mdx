## What is a vector in machine learning?

In the context of machine learning, a vector is a mathematical representation of data. It is an ordered list of numbers that encode the features or attributes of a piece of data.

Vectors can be thought of as points in a multi-dimensional space where each dimension corresponds to a feature.
**For example**, consider a simple dataset about ecommerce `products`. Each product might have features such as `price`, `quality`, and `popularity`.

| Id  | Product                                  | Price ($) | Quality (1 - 10) | Popularity (1 - 10) |
| --- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| 1   | Puma Men Race Black Watch                | 150       | 5                | 8                   |
| 2   | Puma Men Top Fluctuation Red Black Watch | 180       | 7                | 6                   |
| 3   | Inkfruit Women Behind Cream Tshirt       | 5         | 9                | 7                   |

Now, product 1 `Puma Men Race Black Watch` might be represented as the vector `[150, 5, 8]`

In a more complex scenario, like natural language processing (NLP), words or entire sentences can be converted into dense vectors (often referred to as embeddings) that capture the semantic meaning of the text.Vectors play a foundational role in many machine learning algorithms, particularly those that involve distance measurements, such as clustering and classification algorithms.

## What is vector similarity?

Vector similarity is a measure that quantifies how alike two vectors are, typically by evaluating the `distance` or `angle` between them in a multi-dimensional space.
When vectors represent data points, such as texts or images, the similarity score can indicate how similar the underlying data points are in terms of their features or content.

## How to calculate vector similarity?

There are several ways to calculate vector similarity, but some of the most common methods include:

### Euclidean Distance (L2 norm)

**Euclidean Distance (L2 norm)** computes the "straight line" distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. Lower values indicate closer proximity, and hence higher similarity.

<img
  src={EuclideanDistanceFormulaImage}
  alt="EuclideanDistanceFormulaImage"
  width="300"
  className="margin-bottom--md"
/>

Lets consider `product 1` and `product 2` from above ecommerce dataset and calculate `Euclidean Distance` between those products with all features.

<img
  src={EuclideanDistanceSampleImage}
  alt="EuclideanDistanceSampleImage"
  width="600"
  className="margin-bottom--md"
/>

For the purpose of this demonstration, We will consider 2D chart built using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) of `Price vs. Quality` features (rather all features with multi dimensional chart) for our products and calculate `Euclidean Distance` between products with Price & Quality features only.

![chart](./images/euclidean-distance-chart.png)

### Cosine Similarity

**Cosine Similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The cosine similarity value ranges between -1 and 1. A value closer to 1 implies a smaller angle and higher similarity, while a value closer to -1 implies a larger angle and lower similarity. Cosine similarity is particularly popular in NLP when dealing with text vectors.

<img
  src={CosineFormulaImage}
  alt="CosineFormulaImage"
  width="450"
  className="margin-bottom--md"
/>

Note: If two vectors are pointing in the same direction, the cosine of the angle between them is 1. If they're orthogonal, the cosine is 0, and if they're pointing in opposite directions, the cosine is -1.

Lets consider same `product 1` and `product 2` from above ecommerce dataset and calculate `Cosine Distance` between those products with all features.

![sample](./images/cosine-sample.png)

Lets consider 2D chart built using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) of `Price vs. Quality` features for our products and visualize `Cosine Similarity` between products with Price & Quality features only.

### Inner Product

**Inner Product (dot product)** The inner product (or dot product) isn't a distance metric in the traditional sense but can be used to calculate similarity, especially when vectors are normalized (have a magnitude of 1). It's the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.

<img
  src={IpFormulaImage}
  alt="IpFormulaImage"
  width="450"
  className="margin-bottom--md"
/>
Note: The inner product can be thought of as a measure of how much two vectors "align"
in a given vector space. Higher values indicate higher similarity. However, the raw
values can be large for long vectors; hence, normalization is recommended for better
interpretation. If the vectors are normalized, their dot product will be `1 if they
are identical` and `0 if they are orthogonal` (uncorrelated).

Lets consider same `product 1` and `product 2` from above ecommerce dataset and calculate `inner Product` between those products with all features.

:::note
Vectors can also be stored in databases in **binary formats** to save space. In practical applications, it's crucial to strike a balance between the dimensionality of the vectors (which impacts storage and computational costs) and the quality or granularity of the information they capture.

## Generating vectors

The [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) library provides pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned or used out-of-the-box for various NLP (natural language processing) tasks. In our context, we're interested in generating sentence and image embeddings (vector).

:::note
transformers.j library is essentially the JavaScript version of Hugging Face's popular Python library.

To obtain sentence embeddings, let's use a hugging face model called [Xenova/all-distilroberta-v1](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-distilroberta-v1) which is compatible version of [sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1) for transformer.js with ONNX weights.

:::note

<u>[ONNX (Open Neural Network eXchange)](https://onnx.ai) </u> is an open standard
that defines a common set of operators and a common file format to represent deep
learning models in a wide variety of frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow
:::

Below is a Node.js code sample that showcases how to generate vector embeddings for the any sentence provided:

```sh
npm install @xenova/transformers
```

```js title="src/text-vector-gen.ts"
import * as transformers from '@xenova/transformers';

async function generateSentenceEmbeddings(_sentence): Promise<number[]> {
  let modelName = 'Xenova/all-distilroberta-v1';
  let pipe = await transformers.pipeline('feature-extraction', modelName);

  let vectorOutput = await pipe(_sentence, {
    pooling: 'mean',
    normalize: true,
  });

  const embeddings: number[] = Object.values(vectorOutput?.data); //object to array
  return embeddings;
}

export { generateSentenceEmbeddings };
```

```js title="sample output"
const embeddings = await generateSentenceEmbeddings('I Love Redis !');
console.log(embeddings);

We are using <u>[mobilenet model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet)</u> which is trained only on small <u>[set of image classes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/blob/master/mobilenet/imagenet_classes.js)</u>. Selecting an image classification model depends on various factors, such as the dataset size, dataset diversity, computational resources, and the specific needs of the application. There are many image classification models like EfficientNet, ResNets, Vision Transformers (ViT)..etc which can be chosen from based on your requirements.
