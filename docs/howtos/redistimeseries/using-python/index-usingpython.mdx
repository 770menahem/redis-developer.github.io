Time series data is a series of data stored in the time order (Example: Stock performance over time). Industries today are collecting and analyzing time-based data more than ever before. Traditional databases that rely on relational or document data models are designed neither for storing and indexing data based on time, nor for running time-bucketed aggregation queries. Time-series databases fill this void by providing a data model that optimizes data indexing and querying by time.

RedisTimeSeries is a Redis module that allows Redis to be used as a fast in-memory time series database designed to collect, manage, and deliver time series data at scale. The RedisTimeSeries module shares the performance and simplicity aspects of Redis. Under the hood, it uses efficient data structures such as Radix tree to index data by timestamp, which makes it extremely fast and efficient to run time-aggregate queries.

## Python Client for RedisTimeSeries

:::note TIP
As of redis-py 4.0.0, the redistimeseries-py library is deprecated. It's features have been merged into redis-py. Please either install it from pypy or the repo.
:::

Follow the steps below to get started with RedisTimeSeries with Python:

### Step 1. Create a free Cloud account

### Step 2. Create Your database

Choose your preferred cloud vendor. Select the region and then click "Let's start free" to create your free database automatically.

:::info TIP
If you want to create a custom database with your preferred name and type of redis,
click "Create a custom database" option shown in the image.

### Step 4.Installation

```
$ pip install redis
```

### Step 5. Create a script file

```python
 import redis
 r = redis.Redis(host='redis-18386.c110.qa.us-east-1-1.ec2.qa-cloud.redislabs.com', port=<add port>, password=<add password>)
 r.ts().create(2, retension_msecs=5)
```

Save the above file with a name "ts.py".

### Step 6. Executing the python script

```bash
 python3 ts.py
```

### Step 7. Monitor the Redis database

```
