You have multiple ways to run RediSearch:

- building from [sources](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch) and installing it inside an existing Redis Instance
- using [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
- using [Redis Enterprise](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/)
- using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/redisearch/)

Let's use Docker for now.

**1.1 Open a terminal an run the following command**

```
> docker run -it --rm --name redis-search-2 \
   -p 6379:6379 \
   redislabs/redisearch:2.0.2
```

:::note

The container will automatically be removed when it exits (`--rm` parameter).

:::

You have now a Redis instance running with RediSearch installed, let's discover the basics.
