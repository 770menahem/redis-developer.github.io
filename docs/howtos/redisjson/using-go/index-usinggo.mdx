[Go-ReJSON](https://github.com/nitishm/go-rejson) is a Go client for Redis JSON feature. It is a Golang client that support multiple Redis clients such as the print-like Redis-api client [redigo](/develop/golang/) and the type-safe Redis client [go-redis](/develop/golang/).

Follow the below steps to get started with Redis JSON using Go client.

### Step 1. Initialize the Go feature

```bash
 go mod init github.com/my/repo
```

### Step 2. Install Go-redis

```bash
 go get github.com/go-redis/redis/v8
```

### Step 3. Install Go client for Redis JSON

```bash
 go get github.com/nitishm/go-rejson/v4
```

### Step 4. Clone the repository

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/nitishm/go-rejson
 cd go-rejson/example
```

### Step 5. Build the Go package

<b>Command:</b>

```go
 go build json_set/json_set.go
```

<b>Result:</b>

```go
 go: downloading github.com/go-redis/redis/v8 v8.4.4
 go: downloading github.com/gomodule/redigo v1.8.3
 go: downloading go.opentelemetry.io/otel v0.15.0
 go build: build output "json_set" already exists and is a directory
```

### Step 6. Run the Go program

<b>Command:</b>

```go
 go run json_set/json_set.go
```

<b>Result:</b>

```go
 Executing Example_JSONSET for Redigo Client
 Success: OK
 Student read from redis : main.Student{Name:main.Name{First:"Mark", Middle:"S", Last:"Pronto"}, Rank:1}

 Executing Example_JSONSET for Redigo Client
 Success: OK
 Student read from redis : main.Student{Name:main.Name{First:"Mark", Middle:"S", Last:"Pronto"}, Rank:1}
```

<b>Command:</b>

```go
 pwd
 go-rejson/examples
```

<b>Command:</b>

```go
 go run json_array/json_array.go
```

<b>Result:</b>

```go
 Executing Example_JSONSET for Redigo Client
 arr: OK
 arr before pop: [one two three four five]
 Length: 5
 Deleted element: five
 arr after pop: [one two three four]
 Length: 4
 Index of "one": 0
 Out of range: -1
 "ten" not found: -1
 no. of elements left: 2
 arr after trimming to [1,2]: [two three]
 no. of elements: 3
 arr after inserting "one": [one two three]
