"I am a Solution Architect at Capgemini and have been using Redis for 1.5 years. I build/manage/enhance various applications in the enterprise landscape of a major car manufacturer in Europe chain using Java/J2EE stack.

"I am based in Paris, France. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling along the River Seine, camping, reading classic literature and philately.

"I applied to become a Redis Insider because the simplicity and the power of Redis fascinates me. We can do so much with this incredible software. I dug deep in Redis only in the last 15 months and I feel I am still scratching the surface. So many more things to do, so many applications to be made better, faster and more reliable by using the power of Redis."
