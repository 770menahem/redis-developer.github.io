Redis Insiders is our first community ambassador program, launched in May 2022.

Our Redis Insiders are enthusiastic community members who love using Redis, and helping others to use it.  They spread the word through technical talks, blog posts, live streams and more!

## Meet our Redis Insiders

Our current Insiders are...

### Jyotsna Gupta

Jyotsna is based in Bangalore, India and works as a Senior Software Engineer at Gojek (GoPay).  She is an open source enthusiast and has been using Redis for the past three years, with Golang and Java.  She applied to become a Redis Insider because she is passionate about communities and loves to share and learn together.  When sheâ€™s not working or volunteering, she energises herself by playing badminton, table tennis, basketball, Carrom and chess.
