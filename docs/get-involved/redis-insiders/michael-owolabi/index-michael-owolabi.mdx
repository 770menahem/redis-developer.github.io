"I am a Senior Software Engineer at Spleet and have been using Redis for 2+ years. I build software products using Node.js."

"I am based in Lagos, Nigeria, and, in my spare time, I enjoy traveling, adventure, writing and volunteering.

"I applied to become a Redis Insider because as a lover of Redis myself, I wanted an opportunity to meet with and learn from other Redis professionals around the globe and also share my knowledge of Redis through speaking and writing."
