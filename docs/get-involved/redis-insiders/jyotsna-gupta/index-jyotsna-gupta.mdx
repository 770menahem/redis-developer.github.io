"I am an Open Source Enthusiast, working as a Senior Software Engineer at Gojek (GoPay). I am based out of Bangalore, India. I have been using Redis for the last 3 years.

"I applied to become a Redis Insider because I am highly passionate about communities and love to share and learn together, and I am currently trying to get the expertise in Redis at my current workplace.

"Apart from my work and volunteering, I energize myself by playing badminton, table tennis, Carrom, chess and basketball. I prefer to spend most of the time in my room, else I feel to travel the world. If you don’t see me doing any of the above, then you’ll find probably find me sleeping and dreaming for hours, maybe days?"
