"I am a Senior Software Engineer at Vela and have been using Redis for 5 years. I build web, mobile and desktop apps for a variety of industries including shipping / logistics, financial, retail and Hhalth using JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Swift, Java, C# and Python.

"I am based in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago and, in my spare time, I enjoy hiking, fitness/CrossFit, watching movies and learning new technology.

"I applied to become a Redis Insider because I want to be a positive influence in the adoption of Redis as a primary database for developers and business owners."
