## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long festival which takes place every year in October.  It is sponsored by DigitalOcean and aims to encourage people to get involved in open source projects.


Here's a test video embed to see what it looks like...

## How to get involved

We've created a number of GitHub issues for folks who want to contribute to our documentation and demo apps.  You can find them at "links".

### Get a GitHub account and Hacktoberfest account

You'll need a GitHub account to contribute to our repos.  Get a free account at [GitHub.com](github.com).

You'll also need to [register with Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register) (you can do this using your GitHub account) if you want to be in with a chance of [earning swag from DigitalOcean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/participation).  Please note that Redis is not involved in the allocation or sending of swag.

### Finding and working on an issue

1. Find a suitable issue using the links above.  Where possible, we have tagged them according to the level of experience required.

2. Read the guidance notes on each issue carefully so you know what's expected of you.

3. Assign the issue to yourself "screen grab".

4. Open a pull request within two calendar days.  This is to give more people a fair chance at finding an unassigned issue.

5. We will review your pull request and merge it if it's suitable.

In case we need them, we can do **code samples** or _terminal session_ examples:

```bash
$ npm install
```

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
  // do something...
};
```
