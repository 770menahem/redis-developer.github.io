## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long festival which takes place every year in October.  It is sponsored by DigitalOcean and aims to encourage people to get involved in open source projects.


Here's a test video embed to see what it looks like...

## How to get involved

We've created a number of GitHub issues for folks who want to contribute to our documentation and demo apps.  You can find them at "links".

### Finding and working on an issue

1. Find a suitable issue using the links above.  Where possible, we have tagged them according to the level of experience required.

2. Read the guidance notes on each issue carefully so you know what's expected of you.

3. Assign the issue to yourself "screen grab".

4. Open a pull request within two calendar days.  This is to give more people a fair chance at finding an unassigned issue.

5. We will review your pull request and merge it if it's suitable.


This is a level 3 title

* to do...

Maybe we also need...

1. first
2. second
3. third

In case we need them, we can do **code samples** or _terminal session_ examples:

```bash
$ npm install
```

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
  // do something...
};
```
