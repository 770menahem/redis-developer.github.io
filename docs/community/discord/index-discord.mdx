## Channel guide

  - start here
  - news and announcements (you're welcome to post in events, content, live stream, jobs)
  - topical chat (Redis, modules, and language specific channels)
  - Redis University, start with ruxxx (include a regex for geekiness), use these for questions and discussion around specific RedisU classes.
  - Redis Meetups voice and text channels used for live events. Feel free to hop into a video chat room and say hi
  - Help channels - ask your questions here.


## How to get help

We have a help system inspired by the one used by the most excellent Python Discord.

At any given time there are at most three help channels availalbe. Just enter your question to claim the channel. It will be moved from HELP-AVAILABLE to HELP-OCCUPIED. When the question has been answered, you can close the channel with the /close command and then it will be moved to HELP-DORMANT. If the channel is inactive for more than two days it will be automatically closed. Either way, the channel will eventually be recycled for new questions and new questioners.

Who can answer your question? Well... anyone. It might be an admin, a Redis Labs employee, or a fellow Redis user. It's possible your question might not be answered. Perhaps nobody knows the answer or maybe folks are confused by your question. *You* might answer it yourself if you figure it out before someone else does.


## You made it this far

Congratulations on actually reading the Redis Discord server guide. Life is busy and we tend to skim things but you've done the work. As a reward for your attention to detail, please accept our thanks and an elevated level of access on the server. When you join, enter the command `/redeem IAMSOGREAT` in any channel to claim your reward.
