Azure Resource Manager(a.k.a AzureRM) is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment.

The "azurerm_redis_enterprise_cluster" is a resource that manages a Redis Enterprise cluster. This is a template to get started with the 'azurerm_redis_enterprise_cluster' resource available in the 'azurerm' provider with Terraform.

### Prerequisite

1.  [Terraform](https://terraform.io)
2.  [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### Step 1. Getting Started

Login in Azure using the Azure CLI

```bash
az login
```
>Login with a Service Principal will also work

Login using an Azure Service Principal

```bash
az login --service-principal --username APP_ID --tenant TENANT_ID --password [password || /path/to/cert]
```
### Step 2: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/acre-terraform
```


### Step 3: Initialize the repository

```bash
cd acre-terraform
terraform init
```
>The output should include: ```Terraform has been successfully initialized```


### Step 4: Modify the variables(optional)

The default variables are setup to deploy the smallest 'E10' instance into the 'East US' region.
Changes can be made by updating the ```variables.tf``` file.


### Step 5: Verify the plan

The 'plan' output will show you everything being created by the template.

```bash
terraform plan
```
>The output should include: ```Plan: 18 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.```

### Step 6: Apply the plan

When the plan looks good, 'apply' the template.

```bash
terraform apply
```
>The output should include: ```Apply complete! Resources: 18 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.```

### Step 7: Connect using generated output

The access key is sensitive, so viewing the outputs must be requested specifically.
The output is also in JSON format.

```bash
terraform output redisgeek_config
```
> Example output:
```
{
"hostname" = "redisgeek-8jy4.eastus.redisenterprise.cache.azure.net"
"access_key" = "DQYABC3uRMyDguE1236Xkvv3TprUcqBWTRkfgOPjs82Y="
"port" = "10000"
}
```
