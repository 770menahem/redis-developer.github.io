## Installing and Create Redis database from Source


### Download, extract and compile Redis with:
 
```
wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
```

It is a good idea to copy both the Redis server and the command line interface into the proper places, either manually using the following commands:

```
sudo cp src/redis-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp src/redis-cli /usr/local/bin/
```
Or just using ```sudo make install.```

The binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory. Run Redis with:
 
```
$ redis-server
```

You can interact with Redis using the built-in client:

```
$ src/redis-cli
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
"bar"
```
