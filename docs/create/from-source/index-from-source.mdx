### Step 1: Download, extract and compile Redis

Redis stands for  REmote  DIctionary  Server. Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store most commonly used as a primary database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis cache delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT.

In order to install Redis from source, first you need to download the latest Redis source code. 
The Redis source code is available to download [here](https://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz). You can verify the integrity of these downloads by checking them against the digests in the [redis-hashes git repository](https://github.com/redis/redis-hashes)

 
```
wget https://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
```

It is a good idea to copy both the Redis server and the command line interface into the proper places, either manually using the following commands:

```
sudo cp src/redis-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp src/redis-cli /usr/local/bin/
```
Or just using ```sudo make install.```

The binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory. 


### Step 2: Running Redis Server

Install Redis server by running the following redis command:
 
```
$ redis-server
```
Please note that you don't need to restart the Redis service

### Step 3: Interacting with Redis Client

Once the redis installation gets completed, you can use redis client software to perform the remote connection to the redis instance.
Use the below redis cli command to SET and GET the data values:
```
$ src/redis-cli
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
"bar"
```

Please note: By default, Redis has 0-15 indexes for databases, you can change that number databases NUMBER in redis.conf.
The redis.conf is a configuration file recommended in case you want to configure Redis.
